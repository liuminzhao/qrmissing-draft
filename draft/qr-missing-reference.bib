In this study, recently developed techniques for quantile regression are applied to every March Current Population Survey since 1964 and changes in the return to schooling and experience at different points of the wage distribution are examined. The quantile regression technique parsimoniously describes the entire conditional wage distribution. This conditional distribution is used to examine changes in within-group wage inequality as measured by the difference between conditional quantiles. Two linear models are considered: a simple one-group model, and a 16-group model. The results suggest that the returns to schooling and experience differ across quantiles of the wage distribution but their patterns of change are similar. Significant differences in wage inequality are also found across the various skill groups. The paper also presents a new imputation method for CPS data.},

The estimator which minimizes the sum of absolute residuals is an important special case. Some equivariance properties and the joint asymptotic distribution of regression quantiles are established. These results permit a natural generalization of the linear model of certain well-known robust estimators of location. Estimators are suggested, which have comparable efficiency to least squares for Gaussian linear models while substantially out-performing the least-squares estimator over a wide class of non-Gaussian error distributions.},

 abstract = {Median regression models become an attractive alternative to mean regression models when employing flexible families of distributions for the errors. Classical approaches are typically algorithmic with desirable properties emerging asymptotically. However, nonparametric error models may be most attractive in the case of smaller sample sizes where parametric specifications are difficult to justify. Hence, a Bayesian approach, enabling exact inference given the observed data, may be appealing. In this context there is little Bayesian work. We develop two fully Bayesian modeling approaches, employing mixture models, for the errors in a median regression model. The associated families of error distributions allow for increased variability, skewness, and flexible tail behavior. The first family is semiparametric with extra variability captured nonparametrically through mixing and skewness handled parametrically. The second family, a fully nonparametric one, includes all unimodal densities on the real line with median (and mode) equal to zero. In conjunction with a parametric regression specification, two semiparametric median regression models arise. After fitting such models by using Gibbs sampling, full posterior inference for general population functionals is possible. The approach can also be applied when censored observations are present, leading to semiparametric censored median regression modeling. We illustrate with two examples, one involving censoring.},

abstract ={Quantile regression has emerged as a useful supplement to ordinary mean regression. Traditional frequentist quantile regression makes very minimal assumptions on the form of the error distribution and thus is able to accommodate nonnormal errors, which are common in many applications. However, inference for these models is challenging, particularly for clustered or censored data. A Bayesian approach enables exact inference and is well suited to incorporate clustered, missing, or censored data. In this paper, we propose a flexible Bayesian quantile regression model. We assume that the error distribution is an infinite mixture of Gaussian densities subject to a stochastic constraint that enables inference on the quantile of interest. This method outperforms the traditional frequentist method under a wide array of simulated data models. We extend the proposed approach to analyze clustered data. Here, we differentiate between and develop conditional and marginal models for clustered data. We apply our methods to analyze a multipatient apnea duration data set.},

     abstract = {Likelihood-based inference for longitudinal binary data can be obtained using a generalized linear mixed model (Breslow, N. and Clayton, D. G., 1993, Journal of the American Statistical Association 88, 9-25; Wolfinger, R. and O'Connell, M., 1993, Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation 48, 233-243), given the recent improvements in computational approaches. Alternatively, Fitzmaurice and Laird (1993, Biometrika 80, 141-151), Molenberghs and Lesaffre (1994, Journal of the American Statistical Association 89, 633-644), and Heagerty and Zeger (1996, Journal of the American Statistical Association 91, 1024-1036) have developed a likelihood-based inference that adopts a marginal mean regression parameter and completes full specification of the joint multivariate distribution through either canonical and/or marginal higher moment assumptions. Each of these marginal approaches is computationally intense and currently limited to small cluster sizes. In this manuscript, an alternative parameterization of the logistic-normal random effects model is adopted, and both likelihood and estimating equation approaches to parameter estimation are studied. A key feature of the proposed approach is that marginal regression parameters are adopted that still permit individual-level predictions or contrasts. An example is presented where scientific interest is in both the mean response and the covariance among repeated measurements.},
